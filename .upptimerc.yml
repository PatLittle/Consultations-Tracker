  introTitle: '[Consulting with Canadians](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/consultations/consultingcanadians.html)
    is Canada''s one stop shop for finding Consultations.'
  introMessage: This tool scans all Consultations from [Consulting with Canadians](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/consultations/consultingcanadians.html)
    which are listed as either Open or Planned and checks to ensure the profile page
    is an active link and tries each link every 4 hours. In addition to uptime monitoring,
    several handy reports are generated such as Consultations starting and ending
    soon, consultations overdue to start, consulations open beyond their end date,
    etc.
